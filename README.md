# Toys-And-Models



Projet SQL / Wild Code School 2020

Objective : Your dashboard should revolve around these 4 main topics : sales, finance, logistics and human resources. Here are the indicators that should be present in your dashboard. Visualisations would also be appreciated. And you are invited to practice your advisory role, by proposing additional KPIs and charts.

Sales: The number of products sold by category and by month, with comparison and rate of change compared to the same month of the previous year. Finances: ->The turnover of the orders of the last two months by country. -> Orders that have not yet been paid. Logistics: The stock of the 5 most ordered products. Human Resources: Each month, the 2 sellers with the highest turnover.

This was a project to train on SQL and visualisations.

Used Python and GeoPy to get coordinates of cities, and used that to create a map in Grafana.

Created a view for each KPI

Dashboard in Grafana.

Database was given by the school.

Here is a look at some of the visualisations.
